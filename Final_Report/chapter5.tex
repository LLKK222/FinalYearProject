\chapter{Community Detection in Financial Networks}

\label{cha:communityDetectionFinancialNetworks}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this chapter we aim to apply algorithms to detect communities within real-world financial networks.
Firstly, we explain the process of gathering the data to create the financial networks.
Then we investigate and apply different community detection algorithms and compare their performance on both synthetically generated and real world data.

\section{Real-world Financial Networks}
\label{sec:constructingRealWorldFinancialNetworks}

The dataset we use consists of daily closing prices of 80 stocks in the FTSE 100 index, which we obtained from \cite{YahFi}. The time period considered is between the beginning of 2004 to the end of 2013, a total of 2501 prices. This is the data we obtained after the removal of a few data points due to incomplete data across different stocks. The complete list of stocks is given in \cref{app:listFTSE100Stocks}. We then calculated, for each stock and for each time period, the logarithmic return. We generated a time series of these returns and associated each stock with a single time series.
